# generic_shop_app

Flutter project aimed at providing shop services with "generic" implementations;
aimed at integrating with multiple server and payment providers.

**Flutter Shop App**

This is a Flutter mobile application boilerplate for an e-commerce shop that can integrate with various backend providers.

**Features:**

- Built with Flutter for a smooth and native experience on iOS and Android.
- Designed to be adaptable to different backend APIs using a plugin architecture.
- Offers basic shop functionalities like product browsing, cart management, and checkout.

**Setup:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
pub get
```

3.  **Configure Backend:**

- Create a folder named `backend` inside the `lib` directory.
- Implement separate classes or services for each backend provider you want to support. These classes will handle communication with the respective backend API.
- Configure the appropriate backend by setting environment variables or using a configuration file.

4.  **Run the app:**

- Connect a physical device or start an emulator.
- Run the app using:

  ```bash
  flutter run
  ```

**Backend Integration:**

- The `backend` folder should house backend provider specific classes/services.
- Each service class should implement functionalities like product fetching, adding to cart, and user authentication according to the backend API it interacts with.
- The main application code will use these services to interact with the backend depending on the configured provider.

**Customization:**

- This is a base framework, and you can customize it to fit your specific shop needs.
- You can add new screens, features, and UI elements as required by your shop design.

**Further Considerations:**

- Implement proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms for API interactions.
- Consider using a state management solution like Provider or BLoC for managing application state across screens.
- Securely store user credentials and access tokens (if applicable).

**Note:**

This is a generic starting point, and the specific implementation details will vary depending on the chosen backend providers and desired functionalities.
