This directory contains scripts and resources used for deploying compiled applications.

It typically includes automation tools, configuration files, and deployment instructions
to facilitate the process of moving built applications to production or staging environments.

The scripts may handle tasks such as copying binaries, setting environment variables, running post-deployment checks, and integrating with CI/CD pipelines.
